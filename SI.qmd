### Normalize data

```{r}
#| label: fig-normalized_plot
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: Histograms for all functions after log tranformation.

tar_read(normalize_functions_plot)

```


```{r}
#| label: fig-std_plot
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: Histograms for all functions after standardization to mean 0 and sd.

```{r}
#| label: fig-correlation_plot
#| echo: false

### Plots by group

Analysis by the four groups: primary produces, higher tropic level, c and nutrients cycling.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-model-group
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| tbl-cap: Model output from testing number of functional groups present, summer temperature and annual precipitation on functions realted to primary producers, higher trophic levels, carbon and nutrient cycling.

tar_read(model_group_nr_out)

```


```{r}
#| label: fig-primary-producers
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: Standardized functions related to primary producers in response to number of functional groups present across different precipitation levels and alpine, sub-alpine and boreal habitats. The different functions are shown in different colours and the different groups have different symbols.

tar_read(pp_plot)

```


```{r}
#| label: fig-higher-trophic-level
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: Standardized functions related to higher trophic levels in response to number of functional groups present across different precipitation levels and alpine, sub-alpine and boreal habitats. The different functions are shown in different colours and the different groups have different symbols.

```{r}
#| label: fig-carbon-cycling
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: Standardized functions related to carbon cycling in response to number of functional groups present across different precipitation levels and alpine, sub-alpine and boreal habitats. The different functions are shown in different colours and the different groups have different symbols.

```


```{r}
#| label: fig-nutrients
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: Standardized functions related to nutrient cycling in response to number of functional groups present across different precipitation levels and alpine, sub-alpine and boreal habitats. The different functions are shown in different colours and the different groups have different symbols.
